## [Unreleased]

(none)

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-14

### Added

- Standard Racket collection layout: source in `racklr/`, tests in `racklr-test/`
- Package metadata (`info.rkt`) with multi-collection declaration
- `.gitignore` entries for generated parser artifacts, Racket bytecode, and vendored grammars
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)

### Changed

- Branch renamed from `master` to `main`
- All inter-module `(require "file.rkt")` references converted to collection-style `(require racklr/file)` paths
- Generated parser template now emits `(require racklr/tree)` instead of `(require "tree.rkt")`
- Grammar file paths in tests now use `../grammars-v4/` prefix (tests moved one level deeper)

### Removed

- Flat-file project structure (all `.rkt` files previously in repository root)
